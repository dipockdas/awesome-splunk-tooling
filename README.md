# awesome-splunk-tooling
A repository of useful Splunk tools downloaded from [Splunkbase] (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/)


If you are new to Splunk finding the right tools can be time consuming and often hit and miss, using time you don't have.

I've put this short list of tools together that will help you fast track your development experience with Splunk. It's not a definitive list - but will help you cover the basics. 

This repo comes in two forms 

- hyperlinks to the app on Splunkbase
- zip of apps if you want to save time downloading the apps
